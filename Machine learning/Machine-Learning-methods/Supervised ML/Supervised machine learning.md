# Supervised Machine Learning Projects

This GitHub repository hosts a collection of supervised machine learning algorithms implemented using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn. The algorithms included are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Algorithms

- **Support vector Machine(SVM)**
  - *Definition*: SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that aims to find the hyperplane that best separates data into different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes.
  - *Usage*: Naive Bayes is commonly used in text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis.

- **Logistic Regression**
  - *Definition*: Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome. It's widely employed in binary classification problems.
  - *Usage*: Logistic Regression is used in areas such as medical diagnosis, credit scoring, and marketing analytics.

- **Linear Regression**
  - *Definition*: Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome. It models the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
  - *Usage*: Linear Regression is commonly used in economics, finance, and social sciences for predictive modeling.

- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - *Definition*: KNN is a simple classification and regression algorithm that predicts a data point's class or value based on the majority class or mean of its k-nearest neighbors.
  - *Usage*: KNN is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and anomaly detection.
